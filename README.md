##  Project Description

**UselessGPT** is a collection of **chaotic AI personalities** that give **hilariously unhelpful responses** with **full confidence**.  

It’s an **AI-powered entertainment platform** where **every click leads to confusion and laughter** — because being *useful* is overrated.  

##  The Problem (That Totally Doesn’t Exist)

AI is too helpful.  
It solves real problems.  
It makes lives better.  

Where’s the chaos? The confusion? The fun?  

We felt humanity needed an AI that does the **exact opposite** — and we proudly delivered it.
