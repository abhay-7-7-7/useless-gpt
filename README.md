The Problem (That Totally Doesn’t Exist)
AI is too helpful. It's solving real problems. It's making lives better.
Where’s the chaos? The confusion? The fun?
We felt humanity needed an AI that does the exact opposite — and delivers it proudly.

The Solution (Nobody Asked For)
So, we built CATHI — a platform of chaotic AI modes like:

RoastGPT – Roasts you like your worst enemy at a family reunion

SadboiGPT – Gets sadder the more you talk to it

ConspiracyGPT – Believes the moon landing was fake and your fridge is spying on you

BabyGPT – Talks like a baby, understands like a rock

Timer/Calculator – Even the tools are uselessly confusing

You're welcome.

🛠️ What We Used
Software:
Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Framework: Flask

Libraries/APIs: Ollama (LLaMA 3), fetch API

Tools: VS Code, GitHub, Figma (UI), Postman
